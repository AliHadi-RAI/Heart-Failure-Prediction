# Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning
📖 Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart failure risk using machine learning techniques. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives annually. Early detection and management are key to reducing this toll, and our machine learning model aims to assist healthcare professionals by identifying individuals at risk of heart failure.

The dataset includes various health-related attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type. The project uses this data to implement a binary classification model to predict heart failure risk.
